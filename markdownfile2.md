# SafeERC20
SafeERC20 wraps the basic ERC20 functions (transfer, transferFrom, approve, etc.) in safe methods that handle potential non-standard behavior. If a token returns false or doesnâ€™t return a value at all, SafeERC20 checks for this and reverts the transaction, ensuring that no silent failures occur.
